This is the home page of the W3C Interoperability Remedies Community Group.[^1]

{: .banner}
Our mission is to help legal regulators understand and apply Internet and Web architectural principles -- like privacy, security, internationalisation, and accessibility -- when requiring 'big tech' companies to implement technical specifications.

## Status

We're just getting started; see our [charter](charter.html). Come back soon for more.


## Who Should Participate

We think that the following sorts of people will be able to effectively contribute to this work:

* **Internet and Web standards experts**: Those with deep understanding of and experience with the Internet's and/or Web's principles and architecture
* **Legal regulators**: Those who are likely to impose interoperability and similar requirements upon 'big tech' companies to meet some legal goal
* **Civil society**: Those who advocate for the public interest regarding human rights and similar topics
* **Academics**: Those who have deeply studied the effects of competition regulation, interoperability requirements, the Internet and Web ecosystems, etc.

Others are, of course, welcome to join.

## How to Participate

1. [Join the community group here](https://www.w3.org/community/interop-remedies/join). You will need a free [W3C account](https://www.w3.org/accounts/request); paid W3C Membership is not required.

2. Then, [subscribe](mailto:public-interop-remedies-request@w3.org?subject=subscribe) to the [mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-interop-remedies/) to keep up-to-date with announcements and decisions.

We also have a [Github organisation](https://github.com/interop-remedies-cg) where most of our work will likely take place, but since we're just starting, it's not very active yet.

We'll be **scheduling our first meeting soon**.

'Community Groups' (also known as 'CGs') are less formal gatherings of interested parties to work on a common goal; they do not produce standards ('Recommendations' in W3C-speak), nor do they necessarily represent consensus of the entire W3C.
